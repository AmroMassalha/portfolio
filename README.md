### 2. Change Color Scheme

The portfolio uses a gradient theme. To customize:

```tsx
// In app/page.tsx, find:
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 via-blue-900 to-purple-900">

// Change to your preferred colors:
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-green-900 via-teal-900 to-cyan-900">
```

### 3. Add Your Resume

Place your PDF resume in the `public` folder:

```bash
cp /path/to/your/resume.pdf public/resume.pdf
```

Then update the resume command in the code to trigger an actual download.

### 4. Add New Terminal Commands

```typescript
// Add to the commands object:
newcommand: () => ({
  output: [
    'Your custom output here',
    'Multiple lines supported'
  ]
}),
```
